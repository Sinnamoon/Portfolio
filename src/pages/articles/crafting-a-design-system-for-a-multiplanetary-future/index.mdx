As the world of technology continues to evolve, schools are embracing innovative teaching methods that incorporate cutting-edge tools to enhance students' learning experiences. One such technology is 3D printing, which has seen a surge in popularity and practical applications in recent years. In this blog post, we will explore the world of PLA 3D printers and modelling, with a particular focus on the Creality Ender 3 V2, which has played a significant role in broadening horizons for myself and the students at my school.

When my school decided to invest in an Ender 3 V2, I was thrilled to have the opportunity to run the 3D club and expose my fellow students to this fantastic piece of technology. The Ender 3 V2 is a budget-friendly yet highly reliable PLA 3D printer, capable of producing high-quality prints with impressive precision. PLA (Polylactic Acid) is a biodegradable, eco-friendly material derived from renewable resources like cornstarch, making it an ideal choice for educational purposes.

## Expanding Horizons through 3D Printing
The introduction of the Ender 3 V2 to our school opened up a world of possibilities for both students and teachers alike. We found that 3D printing could have countless educational applications across various subjects. Some of the most notable projects we undertook included:

1. Printing cases for laser machines in the IoT (Internet of Things) class: This allowed our students to build functional prototypes and develop their skills in design and engineering.

2. Creating dark boxes for photography classes: These custom-made boxes enabled students to experiment with different lighting conditions, enhancing their understanding of photography techniques.
Crafting film-making props: Students in our drama and film classes were able to bring their creative visions to life by designing and printing unique props for their productions.

3. Producing prizes for school competitions: 3D printing enabled us to create bespoke awards, adding a personal touch to our school events and acknowledging students' achievements in a meaningful way.

## The Power of STL Code

One of the most exciting aspects of 3D printing is the use of code to create tangible, real-world objects. [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) (STereoLithography) is a file format commonly used for 3D printing. This code essentially provides instructions for the printer, guiding the device in creating a three-dimensional object layer by layer. Here's a snippet of STL code to illustrate how this language translates into the creation of physical objects:

```c
 facet normal 0 -2.22045e-16 -1
    outer loop
      vertex 16.5806 -44.3742 9.85305e-15
      vertex 0 0 0
      vertex 30 -60 1.33227e-14
    endloop
  endfacet
  facet normal 0 -2.22045e-16 -1
    outer loop
      vertex 15.1067 -13.3034 2.95394e-15
      vertex 0 0 0
      vertex 30 0 0
    endloop
  endfacet
```
This code snippet represents just a small portion of an STL file used to create the laser cases for my school. When loaded into a 3D printer like the Ender 3 V2, it guides the device in producing the medal layer by layer, resulting in a tangible object.
## Conclusion

The introduction of the Ender 3 V2 and PLA 3D printing technology to our school has not only broadened my horizons but also those of my fellow students. By integrating 3D printing into various educational applications, we have unlocked a world of creativity, innovation, and hands-on learning experiences. As we continue to explore the potential of this technology, there is no doubt that 3D printing will play an increasingly significant role in shaping the educational landscape of the future.
